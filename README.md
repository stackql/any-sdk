# any-sdk

A golang library to support:
  - traversal algorithms on StackQL augmented openapi doc structure.
  - SQL semantics thereupon.

From those who brought you

[![StackQL](https://stackql.io/img/stackql-banner.png)](https://stackql.io/)

## Evolution to protocol agnostic

The basic idea is a full decouple and abstraction of the interface from openapi.

Based upon the fact that [golang text templates are Turing complete](https://linuxtut.com/en/2072207ec0565a80d2b2/), as are numerous other DSLs, we can use these to define and route SQL input to arbitrary interfaces.  For instance, here is [the brainf@$& interpreter](https://github.com/Syuparn/go-template-bf-interpreter/blob/1b7f6a3720295c93ffa99b58a81f153bd8d7ecc8/bf-interpreter.tpl) described in the article.

As a side note, [this review piece](https://solutionspace.blog/2021/12/04/every-simple-language-will-eventually-end-up-turing-complete/) gives some insight into whay all DSLs wind up Turing complete and also therefore rather messy for narrowband purposes.
